# ReactJS Application with TypeScript and TypeORM using SQL.js

This project is a web application base developed in ReactJS with TypeScript, utilizing TypeORM to manage interactions with a client-side SQL.js database. This setup provides a comprehensive front-end development experience with robust data management capabilities.

## Main Features

- **ReactJS**: JavaScript framework for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript providing static typing to enhance code quality and maintainability.
- **TypeORM**: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that simplifies interactions with the database.
- **SQL.js**: Embedded SQL database that operates entirely on the client side, offering localized data persistence.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/obraems/reactjs-typeorm-sql.js.git
    cd reactjs-typeorm-sql.js
